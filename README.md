# Background #
Tech Connect is a program I joined at JPMorgan Chase that recruits promising non-CS students interested in a software engineering career and trains them to become software engineers witin the company. Training was completed with an external company known as Tech Elevator due to the remote nature of our training as a result of COVID-19. 

# Training Breakdown #
The training was broken down into three modules: 
  1. The first module was a comprehensive overview of Java back-end development. 
  2. The second module was an overview of SQL and relational DB management. 
  3. The third module was focused on front-end development (JSP, HTML, CSS)

The overall goal of the program was becoming familiar and proficient in all layers of the development stack. 

# Work #
For every section in every module, the work I completed should be under the student-exercises folder. 

Every other week of the program involved a more intensive pair programming assignment; pair work is located in folders were 'pair' is indicated in the title. 

After every module, teams of two-three developed capstone projects that tested the material of the module; capstone work is located in folders where 'capstone' is indicated in the title. 

 # Final Capstone
 The final capstone project was a four person project to develop a website given requirements from a program manager. I worked on a team to develop a website that took in information about breweries from users, displayed those breweries, took information about beers in those breweries for users, displayed those beers, and allowed other users to review beers in that brewery. This project can be found under the 'java-blue-capstone-final-team-5' folder.
